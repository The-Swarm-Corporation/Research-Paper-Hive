Our approach leverages language models themselves to emulate users in dynamic, multi-turn conversations and to assess the resulting dialogues. The framework consists of three main components: a player model assuming a specific character role, an interrogator model simulating user behavior, and a judge model evaluating conversation quality. We conducted experiments comparing automated evaluations with human annotations to validate our approach, demonstrating strong correlations across multiple criteria. This work provides a foundation for a robust and dynamic evaluation of model capabilities in interactive scenarios.\n\n## MEDIC: Towards a Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Clinical Applications\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.07314) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07314)\n\nThe rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications has spurred calls for holistic evaluation beyond frequently-cited benchmarks like USMLE, to better reflect real-world performance. While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.\n\n## Agent Workflow Memory\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.07429) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07429)\n\nDespite the potential of language model-based agents to solve real-world tasks such as web navigation, current methods still struggle with long-horizon tasks with complex action trajectories. In contrast, humans can flexibly solve complex tasks by learning reusable task workflows from past experiences and using them to guide future actions. To build agents that can similarly benefit from this process, we introduce Agent Workflow Memory (AWM), a method for inducing commonly reused routines, i.e., workflows, and selectively providing workflows to the agent to guide subsequent generations. AWM flexibly applies to both offline and online scenarios, where agents induce workflows from training examples beforehand or from test queries on the fly. We experiment on two major web navigation benchmarks -- Mind2Web and WebArena -- that collectively cover 1000+ tasks from 200+ domains across travel, shopping, and social media, among others. AWM substantially improves the baseline results by 24.6% and 51.1% relative success rate on Mind2Web and WebArena while reducing the number of steps taken to solve WebArena tasks successfully. Furthermore, online AWM robustly generalizes in cross-task, website, and domain evaluations, surpassing baselines from 8.9 to 14.0 absolute points as train-test task distribution gaps widen.\n\n## Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.07146) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07146)\n\nLinear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n## VMAS: Video-to-Music Generation via Semantic Alignment in Web Music Videos\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.07450) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07450)\n\nWe present a framework for learning to generate background music from video inputs. Unlike existing works that rely on symbolic musical annotations, which are limited in quantity and diversity, our method leverages large-scale web videos accompanied by background music. This enables our model to learn to generate realistic and diverse music. To accomplish this goal, we develop a generative video-music Transformer with a novel semantic video-music alignment scheme. Our model uses a joint autoregressive and contrastive learning objective, which encourages the generation of music aligned with high-level video content. We also introduce a novel video-beat alignment scheme to match the generated music beats with the low-level motions in the video. Lastly, to capture fine-grained visual cues in a video needed for realistic background music generation, we introduce a new temporal video encoder architecture, allowing us to efficiently process videos consisting of many densely sampled frames. We train our framework on our newly curated DISCO-MV dataset, consisting of 2.2M video-music samples, which is orders of magnitude larger than any prior datasets used for video music generation. Our method outperforms existing approaches on the DISCO-MV and MusicCaps datasets according to various music generation evaluation metrics, including human evaluation. Results are available at https://genjib.github.io/project_page/VMAs/index.html\n\n## gsplat: An Open-Source Library for Gaussian Splatting\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06765) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06765)\n\ngsplat is an open-source library designed for training and developing Gaussian Splatting methods. It features a front-end with Python bindings compatible with the PyTorch library and a back-end with highly optimized CUDA kernels. gsplat offers numerous features that enhance the optimization of Gaussian Splatting models, which include optimization improvements for speed, memory, and convergence times. Experimental results demonstrate that gsplat achieves up to 10% less training time and 4x less memory than the original implementation. Utilized in several research projects, gsplat is actively maintained on GitHub. Source code is available at https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat under Apache License 2.0. We welcome contributions from the open-source community.\n\n## Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.04057) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04057)\n\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reveals that large language models are capable of performing complex reasoning via intermediate steps. CoT prompting is primarily categorized into three approaches. The first approach utilizes straightforward prompts like ``Let's think step by step'' to generate a sequential thought process before yielding an answer. The second approach makes use of human-crafted, step-by-step demonstrations to guide the model's reasoning process. The third automates the generation of reasoned demonstrations with the 'Let's think step by step'.This approach sometimes leads to reasoning errors, highlighting the need to diversify demonstrations to mitigate its misleading effects. However, diverse demonstrations pose challenges for effective representations. In this work, we propose ECHO, a self-harmonized chain-of-thought prompting method. It consolidates diverse solution paths into a uniform and effective solution pattern.ECHO demonstrates the best overall performance across three reasoning domains.\n\n## Hi3D: Pursuing High-Resolution Image-to-3D Generation with Video Diffusion Models\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.07452) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07452)\n\nDespite having tremendous progress in image-to-3D generation, existing methods still struggle to produce multi-view consistent images with high-resolution textures in detail, especially in the paradigm of 2D diffusion that lacks 3D awareness. In this work, we present High-resolution Image-to-3D model (Hi3D), a new video diffusion based paradigm that redefines a single image to multi-view images as 3D-aware sequential image generation (i.e., orbital video generation). This methodology delves into the underlying temporal consistency knowledge in video diffusion model that generalizes well to geometry consistency across multiple views in 3D generation. Technically, Hi3D first empowers the pre-trained video diffusion model with 3D-aware prior (camera pose condition), yielding multi-view images with low-resolution texture details. A 3D-aware video-to-video refiner is learnt to further scale up the multi-view images with high-resolution texture details. Such high-resolution multi-view images are further augmented with novel views through 3D Gaussian Splatting, which are finally leveraged to obtain high-fidelity meshes via 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both novel view synthesis and single view reconstruction demonstrate that our Hi3D manages to produce superior multi-view consistency images with highly-detailed textures. Source code and data are available at https://github.com/yanghb22-fdu/Hi3D-Official.\n\n## MVLLaVA: An Intelligent Agent for Unified and Flexible Novel View Synthesis\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.07129) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07129)\n\nThis paper introduces MVLLaVA, an intelligent agent designed for novel view synthesis tasks. MVLLaVA integrates multiple multi-view diffusion models with a large multimodal model, LLaVA, enabling it to handle a wide range of tasks efficiently. MVLLaVA represents a versatile and unified platform that adapts to diverse input types, including a single image, a descriptive caption, or a specific change in viewing azimuth, guided by language instructions for viewpoint generation. We carefully craft task-specific instruction templates, which are subsequently used to fine-tune LLaVA. As a result, MVLLaVA acquires the capability to generate novel view images based on user instructions, demonstrating its flexibility across diverse tasks. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of MVLLaVA, demonstrating its robust performance and versatility in tackling diverse novel view synthesis challenges.\n\n## Can Large Language Models Unlock Novel Scientific Research Ideas?\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06185) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06185)\n\n\"An idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements\" (Young, J.W.). The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and publicly available ChatGPT have marked a significant turning point in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into people's everyday lives. This study explores the capability of LLMs in generating novel research ideas based on information from research papers. We conduct a thorough examination of 4 LLMs in five domains (e.g., Chemistry, Computer, Economics, Medical, and Physics). We found that the future research ideas generated by Claude-2 and GPT-4 are more aligned with the author's perspective than GPT-3.5 and Gemini. We also found that Claude-2 generates more diverse future research ideas than GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.0. We further performed a human evaluation of the novelty, relevancy, and feasibility of the generated future research ideas. This investigation offers insights into the evolving role of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and limitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and utilizing language models for generating future research ideas. We make our datasets and codes publicly available.\n\n## Instant Facial Gaussians Translator for Relightable and Interactable Facial Rendering\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.07441) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07441)\n\nWe propose GauFace, a novel Gaussian Splatting representation, tailored for efficient animation and rendering of physically-based facial assets. Leveraging strong geometric priors and constrained optimization, GauFace ensures a neat and structured Gaussian representation, delivering high fidelity and real-time facial interaction of 30fps@1440p on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform. Then, we introduce TransGS, a diffusion transformer that instantly translates physically-based facial assets into the corresponding GauFace representations. Specifically, we adopt a patch-based pipeline to handle the vast number of Gaussians effectively. We also introduce a novel pixel-aligned sampling scheme with UV positional encoding to ensure the throughput and rendering quality of GauFace assets generated by our TransGS. Once trained, TransGS can instantly translate facial assets with lighting conditions to GauFace representation, With the rich conditioning modalities, it also enables editing and animation capabilities reminiscent of traditional CG pipelines. We conduct extensive evaluations and user studies, compared to traditional offline and online renderers, as well as recent neural rendering methods, which demonstrate the superior performance of our approach for facial asset rendering. We also showcase diverse immersive applications of facial assets using our TransGS approach and GauFace representation, across various platforms like PCs, phones and even VR headsets.\n\n## ProteinBench: A Holistic Evaluation of Protein Foundation Models\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06744) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06744)\n\nRecent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field.\n\n## Generative Hierarchical Materials Search\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06762) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06762)\n\nGenerative models trained at scale can now produce text, video, and more recently, scientific data such as crystal structures. In applications of generative approaches to materials science, and in particular to crystal structures, the guidance from the domain expert in the form of high-level instructions can be essential for an automated system to output candidate crystals that are viable for downstream research. In this work, we formulate end-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for controllable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language model that takes high-level natural language as input and generates intermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and (2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and generates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally uses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from the generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three components to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible structures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of directly using language models to generate structures both in satisfying user request and in generating low-energy structures. We confirm that GenMS is able to generate common crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels, solely from natural language input, and hence can form the foundation for more complex structure generation in near future.\n\n## SUPER: Evaluating Agents on Setting Up and Executing Tasks from Research Repositories\n\n[Open in Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.07440) | [Open PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07440)\n\nGiven that Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in writing code, can they now be used to autonomously reproduce results from research repositories? Such a capability would be a boon to the research community, helping researchers validate, understand, and extend prior work. To advance towards this goal, we introduce SUPER, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of LLMs in setting up and executing tasks from research repositories. SUPERaims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. Our benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development. We introduce various evaluation measures to assess both task success and progress, utilizing gold solutions when available or approximations otherwise. We show that state-of-the-art approaches struggle to solve these problems with the best model (GPT-4o) solving only 16.3% of the end-to-end set, and 46.1% of the scenarios. This illustrates the challenge of this task, and suggests that SUPER can serve as a valuable resource for the community to make and measure progress.\n\n\n    ",
